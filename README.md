The very beginnings of a web frame work that can meta code in a variety of languages.

Right now I've only worked out variables and arrays and writting out some html. 
The interface as of right now is only usable in the terminal but after I get most of what is refered to in 
python as the "Filed Storage" (Post, Get, Cookies, etc) and I guess also called super globals in PHP written,
I'll move to the next step of creating a grafic interface and adding a few more front end frame works.

The idea being that a complex web site can be written in a few hours in one of many diffrent languages.
